abstract = {Dimeric complexes composed of d8 square planar metal centers and rigid bridg- ing ligands provide model systems to understand the interplay between attractive dispersion forces and steric strain, in order to assist the development reliable meth- ods to model metal dimer complexes more broadly. [Ir2(dimen)4]2+ (dimen = para- diisocyanomenthane) presents a unique case study for such phenomena, as distortions of the optimal structure of a ligand with limited conformational flexibility counteracts the attractive dispersive forces from the metal and ligand to yield a complex with two ground state deformational isomers. Here, we use ultrafast X-ray solution scattering (XSS) and optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTAS) to reveal the nature of the equilibrium distribution and the exchange rate between the deformational isomers. The two ground state isomers have spectrally distinct electronic excitations that enable the selective excitation of one isomer or the other using a femtosecond duration pulse of visible light. We then track the dynamics of the non-equilibrium depletion of the electronic ground state population – often termed the ground state hole – with ultra- fast XSS and OTAS, revealing a restoration of the ground state equilibrium in 2.3 ps. This experimental study provides a critical test of various density functional approx- imations in the description of bridged d8-d8 metal complexes. Our study shows that reproduction of the primary experimental observations requires a hybrid functional, which includes exact exchange, while also accounting for dispersion interactions.},

@article{Schmerwitz2024,
abstract = {Excited electronic states of molecules and solids play a fundamental role in fields such as catalysis and electronics. In electronic structure calculations, excited states typically correspond to saddle points on the surface described by the variation of the energy as a function of the electronic degrees of freedom. A direct optimization algorithm based on generalized mode following is presented for density functional calculations of excited states. While conventional direct optimization methods based on quasi-Newton algorithms usually converge to the stationary point closest to the initial guess, even minima, the generalized mode following approach systematically targets a saddle point of a specific order l by following the l lowest eigenvectors of the electronic Hessian up in energy. This approach thereby recasts the challenging saddle point search as a minimization, enabling the use of efficient and robust minimization algorithms. The initial guess orbitals and the saddle point order of the target excited state solution are evaluated by performing an initial step of constrained optimization freezing the electronic degrees of freedom involved in the excitation. In the context of Kohn-Sham density functional calculations, typical approximations to the exchange-and-correlation functional suffer from a self-interaction error. The Perdew and Zunger self-interaction correction can alleviate this problem, but makes the energy variant to unitary transformations in the occupied orbital space, introducing a large amount of unphysical solutions that do not fully minimize the self-interaction error. An extension of the generalized mode following method is proposed that ensures convergence to the solution minimizing the self-interaction error.},
