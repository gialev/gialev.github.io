abstract: A strategy is presented for variational orbital optimization in time-independent
  calculations of excited electronic states. The approach involves minimizing the
  energy while constraining the degrees of freedom corresponding to negative curvature
  on the electronic energy surface, followed by fully unconstrained optimization,
  thereby converging on a saddle point. Both steps of this freeze-and-release strategy
  are carried out via direct orbital optimization at a similar cost as ground state
  calculations. The approach is applied in orbital optimized density functional calculations
  and is shown to converge intramolecular charge transfer excited states where the
  common maximum overlap method is unable to prevent collapse to unphysical, charge-delocalized
  solutions. The constrained minimization can also be used to improve the estimate
  of the saddle point order of the target excited state solution, which is required
  as input for generalized mode following methods. Calculations with the local density
  approximation and the generalized gradient approximation functionals PBE and BLYP
  are carried out for a large set of charge transfer excitations in organic molecules
  using both direct optimization as well as the linear-response time-dependent density
  functional theory (TD-DFT) method. The time-independent approach is fully variational
  and provides a relaxed excited state electron density that can be used to quantify
  the extent of charge transfer. The TD-DFT calculations are found to generally overestimate
  the charge transfer distance compared to the orbital optimized calculations, even
  when the TD-DFT relaxed density is used. Furthermore, the orbital optimized calculations
  yield more accurate excitation energy values relative to the theoretical best estimates
  for the medium and long-range charge transfer distances, where the errors of TD-DFT
  are as large as 2 eV.
