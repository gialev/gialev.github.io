        Electronic Excitations and Molecular Dynamics 
      text: |        
        Research group at the Science Institute and Faculty of Physical Sciences of the University of Iceland. 
        
        We develop and apply novel computational methods based on density functional theory to model electronic 
        excitations in molecular and condensed-phase systems. The applications focus on photoactive 
        organic and transition metal compounds for solar energy conversion and photocatalysis. Using atomic-scale 
        simulations of light-driven chemical dynamics, our goal is to bridge underlying mechanisms with direct observations 
        from ultrafast experiments conducted at synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers.
